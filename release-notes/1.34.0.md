See https://github.com/asacolips-projects/13th-age/pull/541 for the list of changes in detail.

## Features
- Added new **Lifecycle Macros** fields to the settings tab of character sheets. These macros
  fire at the start of turn and end of turn for the user who is assigned to that character if
  they're currently logged in. Lifecycle Macros support the following arguments: `this`,
  `speaker`, `actor`, and `archmage`.

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed edge case error when rolling some powers to chat.
