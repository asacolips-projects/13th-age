## Compatible Foundry versions

![Foundry v13.348](https://img.shields.io/badge/Foundry-v13.348-green)

**Note**: Starting from this release the system will *only* support Foundry v13.

## Foundry v13 compatibility
It took rather a lot of fiddly work, but thanks mainly to the heroic efforts of our @ben the system is now compatible with Foundry v13 and its revamped UI.

## Condition Parsing Improvements
Conditions (like `dazed` and `confused`) are now parsed into draggable links even without requiring users to manually wrap them in asterisks, support localization, and attempt to guess the duration of the related Active Effect (supports only a few standard phrasings).
