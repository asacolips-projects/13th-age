## Compatible Foundry versions

![Foundry v13.351](https://img.shields.io/badge/Foundry-v13.351green)

**Note**: this release *only* supports Foundry v13.

## Baseline Monster Generator
Added a monstruous button on the bottom left of the actors tab, which lets you generate a new empty monster actor with its baseline numbers (hp, defences, attack bonus and damage) already filled in based on desired level and strength. It should save creative GMs some time, leaving more for actually creating memorable foes for the players to face.

## Improved Background Roll Dialog
We reworked the background roll dialog, now the most common choices are exploded out into radio buttons to save clicks.

## 2e Vulnerable Support
If the 2e rules are enabled and you're targeting an actor with vulnerabilities (only monsters supported for now) or the `vulnerable` condition, the system will add a new row to power chat cards hinting that the target might take extra damage. Ruling if the vulnerability *actually* applies is left as an exercise for the GM.

## Condition Dragging Improvements
Added the `draggable` attribute to condition and AE tags on sheets, so they can be dragged onto other things.

## Bug fixes
- Fix Rush Attack and Sword Way system rolltables.
- Fix recovery dice overrides not being applied in early enough to be accounted for.
- Fix rendering of powers that lack an actor.
