## Bonus Feature! Add support for token art provided by modules (both editions)

We've added support for modules to include a `archmage-art` flag to enable on-the-fly portrait and token art replacements for compendium actors. For this initial release, we've coordinated with Cora to add one of these mappings to the official [Pathfinder Token Pack: Bestiaries](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pf2e-tokens-bestiaries) premium module. If you have that module purchased and enabled, the 395 monsters included in our `SRD Monsters` compendium will use the fantastic art in the screenshot below! To use this with the PF2e token pack, you'll need 1.0.2 version of that module (or higher).

## Adding custom image mappings

If you would like add your own art mapping in a custom module, you can use this JSON file as an example mapping: https://mattsmithin-files.s3.amazonaws.com/map-archmage.json

Once you have a mapping, you can include that in your custom module by adding the following flags section to your module's manifest:

```json
"flags": {
    "my_module_name": {
        "archmage-art": "modules/my_module_name/map-archmage.json"
    }
}
```
