# Release Notes 1.11.0

- Added support for Foundry 0.8.6
- The system previously had overrides to simulate compendium folders for monsters and powers, but these are not functional in a performant way on 0.8.6. They've been disabled while we work on building a compendium browser as an alternative UI.
