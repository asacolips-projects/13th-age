    value: "<p>A bottle of translucent glass, sealed with lead, with a ghastly face that peers out at you. When you ask it questions, it answers in the form of vague hunches. For tough questions, the face might fade out for a while, apparently searching somewhere for an answer. Owning the bottle gives you +2 bonus to Intelligence-based skill checks, if you have the time (and privacy) to consult the lore bottle. Chances are, your particular lore bottle has some sort of specialty or bias, which you will discover only through use. Unlike most magic items, lore bottles can often be found for sale, but you probably don&rsquo;t want those.</p>\n<p>Quirk: The connection formed with the face in the bottle can be compelling and unsettling, as the spirit literally &ldquo;gets in your head.&rdquo; Each bottle has a different effect on its owner.</p>"
