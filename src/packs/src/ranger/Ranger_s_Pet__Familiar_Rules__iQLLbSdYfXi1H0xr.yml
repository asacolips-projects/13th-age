    value: "<p>Your ranger's pet is a tiny or small animal or creature that aids you\_\
      and provides companionship. It also provides opportunities for improvisation\
      \ between you and the GM.</p><p>Your pet is as intelligent as a normal person.\
      \ It can communicate with you and will stay close you unless you've chosen abilities\
      \ that let it roam. Your pet is on your side but it's not perfectly in your\
      \ control.</p><p>If your pet dies, it can come back to you the next time you\
      \ get a full heal-up. (The method or story used is between you and the GM.)\
      \ Alternatively, you can get a new pet.</p><p>Pets are useless in combat, except\
      \ as indicated by their abilities. Ordinarily they aren't damaged by enemy attacks\
      \ and spells unless the story calls for it.</p><h2>Pet Abilities</h2><p>Choose\
      \ two of the following abilities for your pet.</p><h3>Agile</h3><p>You gain\
      \ a +2 bonus to Dexterity skill checks.</p><h3>Alert, Maybe Even Insightful</h3><p>You\
      \ gain a +2 bonus to Wisdom skill checks.</p><h3>Counter-bite</h3><p>Each battle,\
      \ if your pet is close to you, it bites the first enemy that hits you with a\
      \ melee attack after that attack, dealing [[(@lvl)d4]] damage (no attack roll)\
      \ to that enemy.</p><h3>Flight</h3><p>Your pet flies as well as a hawk. It doesn't\
      \ fly that often and usually sticks with you, but it can do so when its other\
      \ abilities allow.</p><h3>Mimic</h3><p>One battle per day, you gain the use\
      \ of the racial power (without feats) of one nearby ally.</p><h3>Poisonous</h3><p>Once\
      \ per battle, when you hit an enemy engaged with you, you can add [[5]] ongoing\
      \ poison damage per tier to the damage roll.</p><h3>Scout</h3><p>Once per day,\
      \ your pet can separate itself from you and make a reconnaissance run of an\
      \ area or location. Roll an easy skill check for the environment to get your\
      \ pet\_to scout unseen.</p><h3>Tough</h3><p>You gain a +1 save bonus. Tough\
      \ counts as two pet\_abilities.</p><h3>Talkative</h3><p>Your pet\_can talk like\
      \ a person (but the GM speaks for the pet\_more than you do).</p>"
