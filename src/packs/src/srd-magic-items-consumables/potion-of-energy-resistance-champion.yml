    value: "<p>When you drink one of these potions, you gain resistance to a single specified energy type dealt by creatures or hazards of a specific tier for the rest of the battle or for five minutes.</p>\n<p>Resistance from a potion is always 16+.</p>\n<p>Attackers of the tier covered, or lower, must roll a natural 16 or higher on their attack roll to overcome your resistance and do full damage of a type you&rsquo;re resistant to, otherwise they deal half damage. Damage from a source that&rsquo;s a higher tier than your potion ignores your resistance.</p>"
