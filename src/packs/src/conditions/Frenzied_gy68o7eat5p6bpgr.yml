        <p>You take no actions when it isn’t your turn. On your turn, your only
        actions are as follows: choose which of your melee attacks you want to
        use to attack. Then randomly select a nearby creature. You’ll do what
        you can to attack that creature, ally or enemy, with your chosen attack.
        If you need to move to attack your target, you can attempt to disengage
        instead of taking opportunity attacks, even twice if your first attempt
        fails. If a disengage check succeeds you move to engage your target.</p>
