    content: "<p>You take no actions when it isn\u2019t your turn. On your turn, your\
      \ only actions are as follows: choose which of your melee attacks you want to\
      \ use to attack. Then randomly select a nearby creature. You\u2019ll do what\
      \ you can to attack that creature, ally or enemy, with your chosen attack. If\
      \ you need to move to attack your target, you can attempt to disengage instead\
      \ of taking opportunity attacks, even twice if your first attempt fails. If\
      \ a disengage check succeeds you move to engage your target.</p>"
