        <p>You can’t attack. This condition ends if you are attacked by an
        enemy. You can use your actions to do anything other than attack or
        delay, since for the moment it feels to you like there’s some sort of
        terrible misunderstanding between friends. You know who your true allies
        are and can take actions to help them. But you also suspect that
        everyone else might be friends, though not to the point that you need to
        heal them or count them as allies.</p>
