    content: "<p>You are *helpless* and can't take any actions (except to make death\
      \ saves). At the start of your turn, make a death save. To make a death save,\
      \ roll a d20 at the start of your turn. If you roll 16+, use a recovery to return\
      \ to consciousness and heal up to the number of hit points you rolled with your\
      \ recovery. If you roll a natural 20, you get to take actions normally that\
      \ turn. If you roll 15 or less, you take one step toward the grave. After the\
      \ fourth failed death save in a single battle, you die. You also die when you\
      \ reach negative hit points equal to half your maximum hit points. If you\u2019\
      re able to use one of your recoveries (or otherwise get healed) while you are\
      \ dying, ignore your current negative hit points. Start from 0 and add the hit\
      \ points you\u2019ve regained.</p>"
