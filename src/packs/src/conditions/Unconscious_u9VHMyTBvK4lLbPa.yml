        <p>You are *helpless* and can't take any actions (except to make death
        saves). At the start of your turn, make a death save. To make a death
        save, roll a d20 at the start of your turn. If you roll 16+, use a
        recovery to return to consciousness and heal up to the number of hit
        points you rolled with your recovery. If you roll a natural 20, you get
        to take actions normally that turn. If you roll 15 or less, you take one
        step toward the grave. After the fourth failed death save in a single
        battle, you die. You also die when you reach negative hit points equal
        to half your maximum hit points. If you’re able to use one of your
        recoveries (or otherwise get healed) while you are dying, ignore your
        current negative hit points. Start from 0 and add the hit points you’ve
        regained.</p>
