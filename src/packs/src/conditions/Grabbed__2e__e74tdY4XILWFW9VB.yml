    content: "<p>When a monster that is grabbing you starts its turn, it deals automatic\
      \ damage to you as a free action usable once on its turn. This automatic damage\
      \ is in addition to the monster\u2019s normal actions and attacks.</p><p>Wherever\
      \ the amount isn't specified, use half the damage the monster deals with its\
      \ typical melee attack.</p><p>You are engaged with the creature grabbing you,\
      \ and you can't move away unless you teleport, pop free, or successfully disengage.\
      \ You can't make opportunity attacks, but you can make normal attacks on your\
      \ turn.</p><p>If you are smaller than the creature that is grabbing you, it\
      \ can move and carry you along no problem. If you are the same size or larger,\
      \ the creature grabbing you has to let go of you if it wants to move.</p>"
