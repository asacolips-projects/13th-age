        <p>When a monster that is grabbing you starts its turn, it deals
        automatic damage to you as a free action usable once on its turn. This
        automatic damage is in addition to the monsterâ€™s normal actions and
        attacks.</p><p>Wherever the amount isn't specified, use half the damage
        the monster deals with its typical melee attack.</p><p>You are engaged
        with the creature grabbing you, and you can't move away unless you
        teleport, pop free, or successfully disengage. You can't make
        opportunity attacks, but you can make normal attacks on your
        turn.</p><p>If you are smaller than the creature that is grabbing you,
        it can move and carry you along no problem. If you are the same size or
        larger, the creature grabbing you has to let go of you if it wants to
        move.</p>
