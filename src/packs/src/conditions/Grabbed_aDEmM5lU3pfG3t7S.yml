        <p>When you’re grabbed you are engaged with the creature grabbing you
        and you can’t move away unless you teleport, somehow pop free first, or
        successfully disengage. Disengage checks take a –5 penalty unless you
        hit the creature that is grabbing you the same turn that you’re trying
        to disengage.</p><p>If you are smaller than the creature that is
        grabbing you, it can move and carry you along with no problem. If you
        are the same size or larger, it has to let go of you if it wants to
        move.</p><p>Grabbed creatures can’t make opportunity attacks. That also
        applies if the creature grabbing you decides to let go and move away
        from you; it doesn’t have to disengage or take an opportunity attack
        from you, it just leaves you behind.</p><p>Grabbed creatures can’t use
        ranged attacks, although melee and close attacks are fine.</p><p>The
        creature grabbing you gets a +4 attack bonus against you.</p>
