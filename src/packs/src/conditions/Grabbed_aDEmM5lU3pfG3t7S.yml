    content: "<p>When you\u2019re grabbed you are engaged with the creature grabbing\
      \ you and you can\u2019t move away unless you teleport, somehow pop free first,\
      \ or successfully disengage. Disengage checks take a \u20135 penalty unless\
      \ you hit the creature that is grabbing you the same turn that you\u2019re trying\
      \ to disengage.</p><p>If you are smaller than the creature that is grabbing\
      \ you, it can move and carry you along with no problem. If you are the same\
      \ size or larger, it has to let go of you if it wants to move.</p><p>Grabbed\
      \ creatures can\u2019t make opportunity attacks. That also applies if the creature\
      \ grabbing you decides to let go and move away from you; it doesn\u2019t have\
      \ to disengage or take an opportunity attack from you, it just leaves you behind.</p><p>Grabbed\
      \ creatures can\u2019t use ranged attacks, although melee and close attacks\
      \ are fine.</p><p>The creature grabbing you gets a +4 attack bonus against you.</p>"
