    value: "<p>You can ask the corpse a number of yes/no questions that the leftover\
      \ fragments of personality/spirit within the corpse will attempt to answer truthfully\
      \ using the information it had when it died.* The magic uses the caster\u2019\
      s knowledge of language so no translation is needed. The first question is free.</p><p>The\
      \ second question requires a DC 15 necromancy skill check using Intelligence\
      \ if the corpse is \u201Cfriendly,\u201D and Charisma if the corpse is not.\
      \ Increase the DC by +5 for each subsequent question after the second. If you\u2019\
      re using this spell during battle, each question and answer requires a round.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>:\
      \ Just as with the <em><strong>s\xE9ance </strong></em>ability of the Death\
      \ Priest talent, there\u2019s always a 10% chance that the spirit summoned is\
      \ going to lie to you for reasons best known to it and to the GM. The GM rolls\
      \ a d20 secretly before the corpse provides any answers; a 3+ means the spirit\
      \ will speak truly, but a 1 or a 2 means it will lie while appearing to be aiming\
      \ for the truth.</p>"
