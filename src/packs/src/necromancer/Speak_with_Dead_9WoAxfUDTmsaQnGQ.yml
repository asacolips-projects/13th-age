      <p>You can use this spell [[1d3]] times each day (roll during a full
      heal-up when you take it). Each time you use the spell, you must wait
      [[1d6]] hours before casting it again.</p>
  effect:
    type: String
    label: Effect
    value: >-
      <p>You can ask the corpse a number of yes/no questions that the leftover
      fragments of personality/spirit within the corpse will attempt to answer
      truthfully using the information it had when it died.* The magic uses the
      caster’s knowledge of language so no translation is needed. The first
      question is free.</p><p>The second question requires a DC 15 necromancy
      skill check using Intelligence if the corpse is “friendly,” and Charisma
      if the corpse is not. Increase the DC by +5 for each subsequent question
      after the second. If you’re using this spell during battle, each question
      and answer requires a round.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Just as with the
      <em><strong>séance </strong></em>ability of the Death Priest talent,
      there’s always a 10% chance that the spirit summoned is going to lie to
      you for reasons best known to it and to the GM. The GM rolls a d20
      secretly before the corpse provides any answers; a 3+ means the spirit
      will speak truly, but a 1 or a 2 means it will lie while appearing to be
      aiming for the truth.</p>
