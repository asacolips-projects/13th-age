      <p>The 3rd level Elemental Caster spells are the four elemental summoning
      spells: summon air elemental, summon earth elemental, summon fire
      elemental, and summon water elemental. Each summoning spell summons an
      elemental of the same level as the spell.</p><p>Summoned elementals start
      battles with half the hit points of standard elementals.</p><p>Each
      elemental that&rsquo;s at least 5th level has a transformation ability
      that greatly improves its effectiveness in battle. Free elementals
      transform the first time they succeed with their transformation rolls, but
      summoned elementals have to succeed with their transformation rolls twice
      before their transformation takes effect.</p><p>Initiates can choose only
      one summon elemental spell each day, while adepts can choose up to
      two.</p><p>These feats apply to <strong>summoning</strong> spells.</p>

    value: >-
      <h2 id="standard-action-spells">Standard action spells</h2><p>Casting a
      summoning spell generally requires a standard action. The creature(s) you
      summon appears next to you, though feats or powers might enable you to
      summon it nearby instead.</p><h2 id="duration">Duration</h2><p>A summoned
      creature fights for you until the end of the battle or until it drops to 0
      hit points. At 0 hp, summoned creatures are slain and removed from the
      battle.</p><h2 id="one-summoning-spell-at-a-time">One summoning spell at a
      time</h2><p>Each spellcaster can have only a single summoning spell active
      at a time. If all the creatures from an earlier summoning spell have been
      slain, you’re free to cast another. Alternatively,you can dismiss your own
      previously summoned creatures as a quick action to clear the way for a new
      summoning spell.</p><h2 id="halfway-there">Halfway there</h2><p>Summoned
      creatures are not the same as real creatures. They’re partly real, partly
      magical. Their abilities don’t always match the capabilities of the
      creatures that the adventurers encounter for real. Sometimes this is
      reflected in a summoned creature’s attacks or abilities. It’s always
      reflected in a summoned creature’s hit points.</p><h2 id="hit-points">Hit
      points</h2><p>Each summoned creature stat block indicates its base hit
      points. Starting hit points for summoned creatures are nearly always lower
      than hit points for non-summoned versions of the same creature. Some class
      feats might increase the hit points of summoned creatures.</p><h2
      id="actions-on-arrival">Actions on arrival</h2><p>The turn you summon a
      creature, that creature takes its turn immediately after your turn in
      initiative order. During its turn, the summoned creature can act like any
      other creature, taking a standard, move, and quick action. The summoned
      creature continues to take its turn immediately after you (even if your
      initiative order changes) until the end of the battle.</p><h2
      id="escalation-die">Escalation die</h2><p>As a rule, summoned creatures
      don’t benefit from the escalation die. A summoned creature can add the
      escalation die to attacks, however, if you use a quick action to give it
      orders or magical reinforcement. The summoned creature then gets to use
      the escalation die until the start of your next turn, including for
      opportunity attacks and other attacks that it gets to make during other
      creatures’ turns.</p><p>For example, during the turn you summon the
      creature, you use a quick action afterward to give it orders, allowing it
      to use the escalation die bonus. At the start of your next turn, the
      creature no longer gets to use the escalation die, so you’ll have to use
      another quick action again during that turn for the creature to keep
      getting the benefit.</p><p>If you’ve summoned a mob of mooks, a single
      quick action lets every member of the mob use the escalation die.</p><h2
      id="allies">Allies</h2><p>Summoned creatures generally count as your
      allies (for roleplaying as well as for resolving effects).</p><h2
      id="no-recoveries-bad-healing">No recoveries, bad healing</h2><p>Summoned
      creatures don’t have recoveries. If you cast a healing spell on a summoned
      creature that requires the use of a recovery, the summoned creature heals
      hit points equal to your level. If you use an effect that would heal a
      summoned creature without using a recovery, the summoned creature only
      heals half the normal hit points of the effect. Temporary hit points still
      work normally.</p><h2 id="no-nastier-specials">No nastier
      specials</h2><p>Creatures you summon don’t use nastier specials.</p><h2
      id="spell-or-creature">Spell or creature</h2><p>When a summoning spell is
      cast, it’s definitely a spell. After casting the spell, a summoned
      creature is a creature.</p>
