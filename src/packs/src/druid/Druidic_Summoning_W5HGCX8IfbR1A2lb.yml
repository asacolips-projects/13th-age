    value: "<h2 id=\"standard-action-spells\">Standard action spells</h2><p>Casting\
      \ a summoning spell generally requires a standard action. The creature(s) you\
      \ summon appears next to you, though feats or powers might enable you to summon\
      \ it nearby instead.</p><h2 id=\"duration\">Duration</h2><p>A summoned creature\
      \ fights for you until the end of the battle or until it drops to 0 hit points.\
      \ At 0 hp, summoned creatures are slain and removed from the battle.</p><h2\
      \ id=\"one-summoning-spell-at-a-time\">One summoning spell at a time</h2><p>Each\
      \ spellcaster can have only a single summoning spell active at a time. If all\
      \ the creatures from an earlier summoning spell have been slain, you\u2019re\
      \ free to cast another. Alternatively,you can dismiss your own previously summoned\
      \ creatures as a quick action to clear the way for a new summoning spell.</p><h2\
      \ id=\"halfway-there\">Halfway there</h2><p>Summoned creatures are not the same\
      \ as real creatures. They\u2019re partly real, partly magical. Their abilities\
      \ don\u2019t always match the capabilities of the creatures that the adventurers\
      \ encounter for real. Sometimes this is reflected in a summoned creature\u2019\
      s attacks or abilities. It\u2019s always reflected in a summoned creature\u2019\
      s hit points.</p><h2 id=\"hit-points\">Hit points</h2><p>Each summoned creature\
      \ stat block indicates its base hit points. Starting hit points for summoned\
      \ creatures are nearly always lower than hit points for non-summoned versions\
      \ of the same creature. Some class feats might increase the hit points of summoned\
      \ creatures.</p><h2 id=\"actions-on-arrival\">Actions on arrival</h2><p>The\
      \ turn you summon a creature, that creature takes its turn immediately after\
      \ your turn in initiative order. During its turn, the summoned creature can\
      \ act like any other creature, taking a standard, move, and quick action. The\
      \ summoned creature continues to take its turn immediately after you (even if\
      \ your initiative order changes) until the end of the battle.</p><h2 id=\"escalation-die\"\
      >Escalation die</h2><p>As a rule, summoned creatures don\u2019t benefit from\
      \ the escalation die. A summoned creature can add the escalation die to attacks,\
      \ however, if you use a quick action to give it orders or magical reinforcement.\
      \ The summoned creature then gets to use the escalation die until the start\
      \ of your next turn, including for opportunity attacks and other attacks that\
      \ it gets to make during other creatures\u2019 turns.</p><p>For example, during\
      \ the turn you summon the creature, you use a quick action afterward to give\
      \ it orders, allowing it to use the escalation die bonus. At the start of your\
      \ next turn, the creature no longer gets to use the escalation die, so you\u2019\
      ll have to use another quick action again during that turn for the creature\
      \ to keep getting the benefit.</p><p>If you\u2019ve summoned a mob of mooks,\
      \ a single quick action lets every member of the mob use the escalation die.</p><h2\
      \ id=\"allies\">Allies</h2><p>Summoned creatures generally count as your allies\
      \ (for roleplaying as well as for resolving effects).</p><h2 id=\"no-recoveries-bad-healing\"\
      >No recoveries, bad healing</h2><p>Summoned creatures don\u2019t have recoveries.\
      \ If you cast a healing spell on a summoned creature that requires the use of\
      \ a recovery, the summoned creature heals hit points equal to your level. If\
      \ you use an effect that would heal a summoned creature without using a recovery,\
      \ the summoned creature only heals half the normal hit points of the effect.\
      \ Temporary hit points still work normally.</p><h2 id=\"no-nastier-specials\"\
      >No nastier specials</h2><p>Creatures you summon don\u2019t use nastier specials.</p><h2\
      \ id=\"spell-or-creature\">Spell or creature</h2><p>When a summoning spell is\
      \ cast, it\u2019s definitely a spell. After casting the spell, a summoned creature\
      \ is a creature.</p>"
