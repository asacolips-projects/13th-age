    value: "<p>Scout forms are magical versions of normal, smaller animals that are\
      \ useful for scouting, such as bobcats, coyotes, owls, lizards, dire rats, giant\
      \ spiders, and so on. In scout form, you shouldn\u2019t have any problem slipping\
      \ through the world without being troubled by any but the most serious defenses.\
      \ However, you don\u2019t look like a natural animal; there\u2019s something\
      \ extremely magical about you.</p><p>Becoming a small animal isn\u2019t a perfect\
      \ translation of self. Your humanoid brain doesn\u2019t work the same when you\u2019\
      ve shifted into scout form. You don\u2019t talk. You can\u2019t cast spells.\
      \ Your magical items and possessions change shape with you, but you don\u2019\
      t get to use them in scout form. You maintain your identity and know who your\
      \ allies are, but you\u2019re as much an animal as a person while in the form.</p><p>Fighting\
      \ in scout form should be avoided unless you\u2019re fighting a mundane animal.\
      \ If you do attempt to fight, your attacker hits you unless he rolls a natural\
      \ 1, and taking damage this way transforms you back into humanoid form.</p><p>Transforming\
      \ from humanoid or beast form into scout form requires a standard action. To\
      \ transform back to human form from scout form requires a quick action. A Shifter\
      \ adept can transform directly from scout to beast form (as a quick action),\
      \ but a Shifter initiate must transform to human form first. You can only shift\
      \ once per round. You can stay in scout form as long as you like, or switch\
      \ back to humanoid form and then back again the next round.</p><p>Shifting into\
      \ scout form is a daily, but you can do it at will. You can shift for roleplaying\
      \ reasons, or for combat reconnaissance. To gain an advantage for an upcoming\
      \ battle (or one just about to start), using your scout form requires a skill\
      \ check.</p><p>Before rolling initiative, you expend one daily scout form use\
      \ and roll a skill check to see how successful you were with your combat recon.\
      \ Depending on the terrain, the weather, and the particular enemies or dangers,\
      \ the GM will ask you to use an ability score that makes sense for the situation\
      \ just like any other check, though Wisdom, Dexterity, and Strength are often\
      \ common choices.</p><p>You\u2019ll normally roll against the standard difficulty\
      \ of the current environment. While in scout form in an adventurer-tier area,\
      \ the normal check starts at DC 15, a hard check is DC 20, and a ridiculously\
      \ hard check is DC 25. Champion tier increases the DC by 5, and epic tier by\
      \ 5 more. Note that a successful check that qualifies for a higher DC gains\
      \ you the information/advantage for that result, plus any lower results. A normal\
      \ success or better probably negates any chance of an ambush or surprise by\
      \ the enemy you\u2019ve scouted.</p><p><b>Failure:</b> Nothing came of your\
      \ scouting.</p><p><b>Normal success:</b> You gain a +4 bonus to initiative this\
      \ battle.</p><p><b>Hard success:</b> As a free action at some point during the\
      \ battle, you can grant one of your allies a reroll on an attack roll or save.\
      \ That ally must take the new result. You must explain how something that happened\
      \ while you were scouting contributed to this benefit.</p><p><b>Ridiculously\
      \ hard success:</b> The GM chooses between giving you a reroll at some point\
      \ during the battle, or giving you a floating story-guide icon relationship\
      \ result of 6 with a random icon.</p><p>You only need to take one of the two\
      \ adventurer-tier feats to access the champion-tier feat. You can also take\
      \ both adventurer-tier feats, if you wish.</p>"
