      <p>Scout forms are magical versions of normal, smaller animals that are
      useful for scouting, such as bobcats, coyotes, owls, lizards, dire rats,
      giant spiders, and so on. In scout form, you shouldn’t have any problem
      slipping through the world without being troubled by any but the most
      serious defenses. However, you don’t look like a natural animal; there’s
      something extremely magical about you.</p><p>Becoming a small animal isn’t
      a perfect translation of self. Your humanoid brain doesn’t work the same
      when you’ve shifted into scout form. You don’t talk. You can’t cast
      spells. Your magical items and possessions change shape with you, but you
      don’t get to use them in scout form. You maintain your identity and know
      who your allies are, but you’re as much an animal as a person while in the
      form.</p><p>Fighting in scout form should be avoided unless you’re
      fighting a mundane animal. If you do attempt to fight, your attacker hits
      you unless he rolls a natural 1, and taking damage this way transforms you
      back into humanoid form.</p><p>Transforming from humanoid or beast form
      into scout form requires a standard action. To transform back to human
      form from scout form requires a quick action. A Shifter adept can
      transform directly from scout to beast form (as a quick action), but a
      Shifter initiate must transform to human form first. You can only shift
      once per round. You can stay in scout form as long as you like, or switch
      back to humanoid form and then back again the next round.</p><p>Shifting
      into scout form is a daily, but you can do it at will. You can shift for
      roleplaying reasons, or for combat reconnaissance. To gain an advantage
      for an upcoming battle (or one just about to start), using your scout form
      requires a skill check.</p><p>Before rolling initiative, you expend one
      daily scout form use and roll a skill check to see how successful you were
      with your combat recon. Depending on the terrain, the weather, and the
      particular enemies or dangers, the GM will ask you to use an ability score
      that makes sense for the situation just like any other check, though
      Wisdom, Dexterity, and Strength are often common choices.</p><p>You’ll
      normally roll against the standard difficulty of the current environment.
      While in scout form in an adventurer-tier area, the normal check starts at
      DC 15, a hard check is DC 20, and a ridiculously hard check is DC 25.
      Champion tier increases the DC by 5, and epic tier by 5 more. Note that a
      successful check that qualifies for a higher DC gains you the
      information/advantage for that result, plus any lower results. A normal
      success or better probably negates any chance of an ambush or surprise by
      the enemy you’ve scouted.</p><p><b>Failure:</b> Nothing came of your
      scouting.</p><p><b>Normal success:</b> You gain a +4 bonus to initiative
      this battle.</p><p><b>Hard success:</b> As a free action at some point
      during the battle, you can grant one of your allies a reroll on an attack
      roll or save. That ally must take the new result. You must explain how
      something that happened while you were scouting contributed to this
      benefit.</p><p><b>Ridiculously hard success:</b> The GM chooses between
      giving you a reroll at some point during the battle, or giving you a
      floating story-guide icon relationship result of 6 with a random
      icon.</p><p>You only need to take one of the two adventurer-tier feats to
      access the champion-tier feat. You can also take both adventurer-tier
      feats, if you wish.</p>
