      <p>When an enemy engaged with the dragon rolls a natural 1 or 2 with an
      attack roll, the dragon can make an opportunity attack against that
      creature as a free action. The attack is set up by the dragon&rsquo;s
      whipping tail but delivered by the dragon&rsquo;s usual melee attack.</p>
