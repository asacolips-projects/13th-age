    value: <p>Once per battle as a standard action, if the demon is staggered, it
      can summon a single demon ally at least two levels below its own level. The
      allied demon rolls initiative and does not appear on the battlefield until its
      turn starts. (Note that using a gate costs the demon an obligation, so some
      demons would rather flee or die than activate one.)</p>
