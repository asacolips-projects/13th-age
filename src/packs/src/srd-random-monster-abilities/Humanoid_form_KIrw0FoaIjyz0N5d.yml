    value: <p>The dragon is capable of shapechanging into a humanoid form, usually
      of a warrior or spellcaster appropriate to its nature and usually not obviously
      draconic, registering as a normal human or elf or whatever. This ability is
      best used for long-term dragon characters that make it worth the GM&rsquo;s
      time to create a double- or triple-strength humanoid monster to represent the
      shapechanged form. The dragon has the PC-style racial power of their humanoid
      form, but only while in shapechanged form.</p>
