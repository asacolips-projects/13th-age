      <p>The dragon is capable of shapechanging into a humanoid form, usually of
      a warrior or spellcaster appropriate to its nature and usually not
      obviously draconic, registering as a normal human or elf or whatever. This
      ability is best used for long-term dragon characters that make it worth
      the GM&rsquo;s time to create a double- or triple-strength humanoid
      monster to represent the shapechanged form. The dragon has the PC-style
      racial power of their humanoid form, but only while in shapechanged
      form.</p>
