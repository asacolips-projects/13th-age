  description:
    label: Description
    type: String
    value: '<p>A bottle of translucent glass, sealed with lead, with a ghastly face
      that peers out at you. When you ask it questions, it answers in the form of
      vague hunches. For tough questions, the face might fade out for a while, apparently
      searching somewhere for an answer. Owning the bottle gives you +2 bonus to Intelligence-based
      skill checks, if you have the time (and privacy) to consult the lore bottle.
      Chances are, your particular lore bottle has some sort of specialty or bias,
      which you will discover only through use. Unlike most magic items, lore bottles
      can often be found for sale, but you probably don&rsquo;t want those.</p>

      <p>Quirk: The connection formed with the face in the bottle can be compelling
      and unsettling, as the spirit literally &ldquo;gets in your head.&rdquo; Each
      bottle has a different effect on its owner.</p>'
