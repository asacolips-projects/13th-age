      <p>A bottle of translucent glass, sealed with lead, with a ghastly face
      that peers out at you. When you ask it questions, it answers in the form
      of vague hunches. For tough questions, the face might fade out for a
      while, apparently searching somewhere for an answer. Owning the bottle
      gives you +2 bonus to Intelligence-based skill checks, if you have the
      time (and privacy) to consult the lore bottle. Chances are, your
      particular lore bottle has some sort of specialty or bias, which you will
      discover only through use. Unlike most magic items, lore bottles can often
      be found for sale, but you probably don&rsquo;t want those.</p>

      <p>Quirk: The connection formed with the face in the bottle can be
      compelling and unsettling, as the spirit literally &ldquo;gets in your
      head.&rdquo; Each bottle has a different effect on its owner.</p>
