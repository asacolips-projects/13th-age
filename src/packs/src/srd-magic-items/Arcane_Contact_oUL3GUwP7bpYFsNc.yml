    label: Description

    value: '<p>These gloves improve your ability to contact, detect, and distinguish
      supernatural forces, provided you can touch some material object connected to
      a force. If, for example, you are improvising a ritual to gain a vision related
      to the scary artifact you just found, touching the artifact will help. The benefit
      is modest, determined by the GM, and possibly secret. The gloves provide no
      protection against the supernatural forces that touching an artifact might usher
      into your soul.</p>
