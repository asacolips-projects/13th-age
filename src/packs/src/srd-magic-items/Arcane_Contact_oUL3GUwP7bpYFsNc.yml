      <p>These gloves improve your ability to contact, detect, and distinguish
      supernatural forces, provided you can touch some material object connected
      to a force. If, for example, you are improvising a ritual to gain a vision
      related to the scary artifact you just found, touching the artifact will
      help. The benefit is modest, determined by the GM, and possibly secret.
      The gloves provide no protection against the supernatural forces that
      touching an artifact might usher into your soul.</p>
