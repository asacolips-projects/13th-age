      <p>Fifty feet of fine, spidersilk rope, woven so closely that it seems
      like a solid, flexible cable. Once you attune the rope during a full
      heal-up, you can make it entangle things with standard action commands. In
      combat, it&rsquo;s not that useful, because it&rsquo;s slow compared to a
      living thing. If the target is stationary, however, the rope excels at
      reaching, climbing, snaking, coiling, and entangling. You might be able to
      get the rope to bind a ferocious monster, but the rope is likely to get
      destroyed in the process.</p>

      only proper term.</p>
