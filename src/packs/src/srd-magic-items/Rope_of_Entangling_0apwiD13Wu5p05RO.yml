    value: '<p>Fifty feet of fine, spidersilk rope, woven so closely that it seems
      like a solid, flexible cable. Once you attune the rope during a full heal-up,
      you can make it entangle things with standard action commands. In combat, it&rsquo;s
      not that useful, because it&rsquo;s slow compared to a living thing. If the
      target is stationary, however, the rope excels at reaching, climbing, snaking,
      coiling, and entangling. You might be able to get the rope to bind a ferocious
      monster, but the rope is likely to get destroyed in the process.</p>

      proper term.</p>'
