    value: '<p>This ammunition has been enchanted against one of the following groups
      of monsters: dragon, giant, orc, or undead. An attack against the designated
      nemesis with this ammunition can be rerolled once if it misses. When you use
      this ammunition, however, it allows each monster of the same group to reroll
      one attack against you that misses this battle. If you use this type of ammunition
      two or more times against the same creature group this battle, monsters of that
      type can instead reroll each attack against you that misses this battle (once
      per attack).</p>'
