      <p>This ammunition has been enchanted against one of the following groups
      of monsters: dragon, giant, orc, or undead. An attack against the
      designated nemesis with this ammunition can be rerolled once if it misses.
      When you use this ammunition, however, it allows each monster of the same
      group to reroll one attack against you that misses this battle. If you use
      this type of ammunition two or more times against the same creature group
      this battle, monsters of that type can instead reroll each attack against
      you that misses this battle (once per attack).</p>
