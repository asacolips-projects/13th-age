      <p>(Standard action &ndash; recharge 16+) The power of this golden staff
      can only be invoked by a spellcaster who has a positive or conflicted
      relationship with any ruling icon. When you use this power, you can use
      the power of any other magic item you have touched since your last full
      heal-up, but you can only use each such individual item power once
      ever.</p>

      <p>Quirk: Becomes certain that they are destined to rule.</p>
