    value: '<p>One in four mugs of ale you drink from this mug will be magically transformed
      into the very finest non-magical dwarven ale. If your relationship with the
      mug is good, the variety might even suit your current mood and the odds of getting
      a good brew might improve in your favor. But really, who&rsquo;s going to complain
      about putting down a second, or even third, mug for the chance to get a taste
      of the best stuff? When that excellent ale does show up, you can share a sip
      or two with a friend, but other attempts to capitalize on this mug&rsquo;s magic
      will just shut it down until it can find a more suitable owner.</p>

      <p>Quirk: Speaks in dwarven, especially while drunk, even if ordinarily unable
      to speak dwarven.</p>'
