      <p>One in four mugs of ale you drink from this mug will be magically
      transformed into the very finest non-magical dwarven ale. If your
      relationship with the mug is good, the variety might even suit your
      current mood and the odds of getting a good brew might improve in your
      favor. But really, who&rsquo;s going to complain about putting down a
      second, or even third, mug for the chance to get a taste of the best
      stuff? When that excellent ale does show up, you can share a sip or two
      with a friend, but other attempts to capitalize on this mug&rsquo;s magic
      will just shut it down until it can find a more suitable owner.</p>

      <p>Quirk: Speaks in dwarven, especially while drunk, even if ordinarily
      unable to speak dwarven.</p>
