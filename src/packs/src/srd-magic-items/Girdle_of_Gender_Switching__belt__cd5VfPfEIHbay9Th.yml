      <p>Wide leather belt with acorn designs.</p>

      <p>Always: Increase your total recoveries by one, but your gender is
      switched. Removing the belt reverses the effect but it teleports back onto
      you if removed for more than 10 minutes. In addition, minor shifts in
      weight distribution throw your balance off, and you take a &ndash;1
      penalty with melee attacks during your first battle each day.</p>
