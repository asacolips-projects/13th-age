    value: '<p>Wide leather belt with acorn designs.</p>

      <p>Always: Increase your total recoveries by one, but your gender is switched.
      Removing the belt reverses the effect but it teleports back onto you if removed
      for more than 10 minutes. In addition, minor shifts in weight distribution throw
      your balance off, and you take a &ndash;1 penalty with melee attacks during
      your first battle each day.</p>'
