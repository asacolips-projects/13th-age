      <p>(Recharge 11+) This spiked shield sports a massive dragon fang that
      wounds enemies. When an enemy engaged with you misses you with a melee
      attack, make a basic melee attack against the enemy as a free action, with
      a +2 attack bonus per tier of the shield (adventurer: +2, champion: +4,
      epic: +6). On a hit, the attack deals [[2d6]] damage; on a miss, it deals
      [[2]] damage (champion: [[4d8]] damage, or [[5]] on a miss; epic: [[8d10]]
      damage, or [[12]] on miss).</p>

      <p>Quirk: Compares everything to dragons or to draconic things, and judges
      actions by how they stack up to draconic expectations.</p>
