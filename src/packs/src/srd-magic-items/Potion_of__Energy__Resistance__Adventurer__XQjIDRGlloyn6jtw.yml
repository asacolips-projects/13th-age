      <p>When you drink one of these potions, you gain resistance to a single
      specified energy type dealt by creatures or hazards of a specific tier for
      the rest of the battle or for five minutes.</p>

      <p>Resistance from a potion is always 16+.</p>

      <p>Attackers of the tier covered, or lower, must roll a natural 16 or
      higher on their attack roll to overcome your resistance and do full damage
      of a type you&rsquo;re resistant to, otherwise they deal half damage.
      Damage from a source that&rsquo;s a higher tier than your potion ignores
      your resistance.</p>
