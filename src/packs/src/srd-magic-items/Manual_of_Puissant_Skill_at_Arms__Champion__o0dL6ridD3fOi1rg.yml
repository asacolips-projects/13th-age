      <p>(Recharge 11+) When you miss with a melee attack, reroll the attack
      using +15 as your attack bonus instead of your own bonus (epic: +20). If
      an arcane spellcaster reads this manual, it hurts their brain and
      permanently reduces their maximum hit points by 4 (epic: by 10).</p>

      <p>Quirk: Constantly checking self out and flexing, and seems to want to
      be caught doing that.</p>
