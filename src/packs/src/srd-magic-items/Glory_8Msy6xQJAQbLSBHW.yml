      <p>This brilliant, gem-encrusted ring gives you an aura of status (and
      whatever that entails). Everyone can see it, even if they don&rsquo;t know
      why.</p>

      accomplishments are undeserved and that they themselves are frauds. This
      obsession often drives them to heroic acts.</p>
