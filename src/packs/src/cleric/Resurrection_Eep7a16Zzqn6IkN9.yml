    value: "<p>You can bring a creature back to life in more or less normal condition,\
      \ with varying levels of recovery.</p><p><strong>Limited Casting</strong>: The\
      \ first time in your life that you use the spell, you can cast it with a single\
      \ standard action. Using the spell removes one of your spell slots until you\
      \ gain a level. (You get one less spell per full heal-up.) The person you are\
      \ resurrecting comes back at roughly half strength, e.g. expending half their\
      \ recoveries, being *dazed* (save ends), and, for each ability, having a 50%\
      \ chance that it is expended.</p><p>The second time in your life you cast the\
      \ spell, it takes at least three or four rounds and costs you roughly half your\
      \ hit points and daily powers/spells. The person you are resurrecting comes\
      \ back at something like one-quarter strength.</p><p>The third time you cast\
      \ the spell it has to be as a ritual. The spell chews you up and leaves you\
      \ with only a few hit points, then gnaws at the person you have resurrected,\
      \ who takes days to recover well enough to qualify as an adventurer or combatant.</p><p>The\
      \ fourth time you cast the spell it nearly kills you. The resurrection succeeds\
      \ but the person you've resurrected is going to be a mess for a month or more,\
      \ regardless of any other magic you use.</p><p>The fifth time you resurrect\
      \ someone, that's the end of your story and you die. There's only a 50% chance\
      \ that the resurrection spell works on the target. You've used up your quota\
      \ of resurrection magic. You're not coming back via this spell, either.</p><p><strong>Limited\
      \ Resurrection</strong>: If the target of your resurrection spell has been resurrected\
      \ more times than you have cast the spell, there is a 50% chance that the experience\
      \ will play out using\_<em>their</em>\_higher number of resurrections instead\
      \ of the number of times you have cast the spell.</p>"
