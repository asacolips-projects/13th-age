      <p>Bardic songs last for one or more rounds and end with a final verse
      that carries a big payoff. Although magical, bardic songs don't count as
      spells; they don't force the bard to suffer opportunity attacks from
      engaged enemies, and they can't be canceled by effects that can cancel
      spells. In fact, bards can cast spells while in the middle of singing a
      bardic song.</p><p>Each song specifies what type of action starts it. To
      sustain it during the next round, it requires an action and a d20 check
      against its sustain target. If successful, the song can continue with its
      sustained effect for that round. (The next round will require another
      sustain check.) If your attempt to sustain a song fails, the song's final
      verse effect resolves immediately, and then the song's power ends. You can
      start another song on your next round.</p><p>You don't have to try to
      sustain the song at the start of your turn. If you choose not to sustain a
      song, its effects end immediately and you choose whether to use the song's
      final verse effect in the current round or to start a new song. You can't
      do both.</p><p>Some songs have an immediate effect that happens each time
      you start or sustain the song. Others have effects that continue
      throughout the entire round.</p><p>Most songs stop when a bard is knocked
      *unconscious*, silenced, or *stunned*. Having your song stopped this way
      prevents you from getting the final verse effect.</p><p>You can only sing
      one bardic song at a time. If you are singing a song (or spend an action
      to try to sustain a song), you can't start another song that
      round.</p><p>Bardic songs are loud, and cancel any of stealth effects you
      may have.</p>
