    value: <p>Bardic songs last for one or more rounds and end with a final verse
      that carries a big payoff. Although magical, bardic songs don't count as spells;
      they don't force the bard to suffer opportunity attacks from engaged enemies,
      and they can't be canceled by effects that can cancel spells. In fact, bards
      can cast spells while in the middle of singing a bardic song.</p><p>Each song
      specifies what type of action starts it. To sustain it during the next round,
      it requires an action and a d20 check against its sustain target. If successful,
      the song can continue with its sustained effect for that round. (The next round
      will require another sustain check.) If your attempt to sustain a song fails,
      the song's final verse effect resolves immediately, and then the song's power
      ends. You can start another song on your next round.</p><p>You don't have to
      try to sustain the song at the start of your turn. If you choose not to sustain
      a song, its effects end immediately and you choose whether to use the song's
      final verse effect in the current round or to start a new song. You can't do
      both.</p><p>Some songs have an immediate effect that happens each time you start
      or sustain the song. Others have effects that continue throughout the entire
      round.</p><p>Most songs stop when a bard is knocked *unconscious*, silenced,
      or *stunned*. Having your song stopped this way prevents you from getting the
      final verse effect.</p><p>You can only sing one bardic song at a time. If you
      are singing a song (or spend an action to try to sustain a song), you can't
      start another song that round.</p><p>Bardic songs are loud, and cancel any of
      stealth effects you may have.</p>
