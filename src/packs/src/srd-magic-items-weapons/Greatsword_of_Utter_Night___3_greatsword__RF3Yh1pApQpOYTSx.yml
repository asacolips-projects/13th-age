      <p>(Recharge 6+) When you hit with this weapon, you spirit away that enemy
      and yourself to an empty void beyond time where only the two of you face
      each other for a short time. Neither you nor your foe can move, but you
      can sure fight. Your enemy acts first, then you, and then you are both
      spirited back to the real world exactly where you were when the power
      triggered. Bystanders only see a flash of black.</p>

      <p>Quirk: Has disturbing dreams that can&rsquo;t be remembered, or at the
      very least must not be.</p>
