      <p>This living &ldquo;backpack&rdquo; clings to you with tentacles and
      inserts mouthparts into the top of your spine. The segmented limbs of the
      strider usually lie flat against your body but may be commanded to spring
      out and carry you like a long-legged spider</p>

      <p>Always: +2 PD (champion); +3 PD (epic).</p>

      <p>Chuulish recharge: Until the end of the battle or for five minutes, you
      can move on walls or ceilings as easily as you do across the ground.
      (epic: chuulish recharge starts at 11+)</p>

      <p>Quirk: Twitching antenna.</p>
