      <p>Your familiar is a tiny or small animal or creature that aids your
      magic and provides companionship. It also provides opportunities for
      improvisation between you and the GM.</p><p>Your familiar is as
      intelligent as a normal person. It can communicate with you and will stay
      close you unless you've chosen abilities that let it roam. Your familiar
      is on your side but it's not perfectly in your control.</p><p>If your
      familiar dies, it can come back to you the next time you get a full
      heal-up. (The method or story used is between you and the GM.)
      Alternatively, you can get a new familiar.</p><p>Familiars are useless in
      combat, except as indicated by their abilities. Ordinarily they aren't
      damaged by enemy attacks and spells unless the story calls for
      it.</p><h2>Familiar Abilities</h2><p>Choose two of the following abilities
      for your familiar.</p><h3>Agile</h3><p>You gain a +2 bonus to Dexterity
      skill checks.</p><h3>Alert, Maybe Even Insightful</h3><p>You gain a +2
      bonus to Wisdom skill checks.</p><h3>Counter-bite</h3><p>Each battle, if
      your familiar is close to you, it bites the first enemy that hits you with
      a melee attack after that attack, dealing [[(@lvl)d4]] damage (no attack
      roll) to that enemy.</p><h3>Flight</h3><p>Your familiar flies as well as a
      hawk. It doesn't fly that often and usually sticks with you, but it can do
      so when its other abilities allow.</p><h3>Mimic</h3><p>One battle per day,
      you gain the use of the racial power (without feats) of one nearby
      ally.</p><h3>Poisonous</h3><p>Once per battle, when you hit an enemy
      engaged with you, you can add [[5*@tier]] ongoing poison damage to the
      damage roll.</p><h3>Scout</h3><p>Once per day, your familiar can separate
      itself from you and make a reconnaissance run of an area or location. Roll
      an easy skill check for the environment to get your familiar to scout
      unseen.</p><h3>Tough</h3><p>You gain a +1 save bonus. Tough counts as two
      familiar abilities.</p><h3>Talkative</h3><p>Your familiar can talk like a
      person (but the GM speaks for the familiar more than you do).</p>
