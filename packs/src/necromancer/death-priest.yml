    value: "<p>When you have icon relationship advantages you’re waiting to use during a session, you can interpret them as interactions/public discussions with the spirits of the recent or ancient dead in the area, providing information you require (and possibly, when there’s a complication from a 5 roll, also providing that information to your enemies or otherwise getting you into some type of trouble).</p>\n<p><strong>Séance</strong>: Similarly, once per day while you’re not in battle, you can perform a short rite (1–2 minutes) to call upon a spirit of the dead that’s related to a random icon other than a necromantic icon. The spirit will speak to you, relaying information helpfully, or under protest if it’s related to an icon that considers you an enemy or with which you have a negative relationship.</p>\n<p>You can’t always rely on the dead to speak the truth, or to know what they are talking about. Whenever you use the séance power above, the GM secretly rolls a d20 before the discussion.</p>\n<p>On a 3+, the spirit knows what it is talking about. On a 1-2, the information is outdated, sabotaged, or just erroneous. (Note that this roll is only used for séances, not for spirits you talk to thanks to icon advantages mentioned above.)</p>\n<p>At 5th level you can use séance two times per day. At 8th level you can use it three times per day.</p>"

When you shift this relationship, the new point must match any current relationships with that icon, but it can be positive, negative, or conflicted if it’s currently the only point you have with that icon.</p>"
