    value: "<p>You can ask the corpse a number of yes/no questions that the leftover fragments of personality/spirit within the corpse will attempt to answer truthfully using the information it had when it died.* The magic uses the caster’s knowledge of language so no translation is needed. The first question is free.</p>\n<p>The second question requires a DC 15 necromancy skill check using Intelligence if the corpse is “friendly,” and Charisma if the corpse is not. Increase the DC by +5 for each subsequent question after the second. If you’re using this spell during battle, each question and answer requires a round.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Just as with the <em><strong>séance </strong></em>ability of the Death Priest talent, there’s always a 10% chance that the spirit summoned is going to lie to you for reasons best known to it and to the GM. The GM rolls a d20 secretly before the corpse provides any answers; a 3+ means the spirit will speak truly, but a 1 or a 2 means it will lie while appearing to be aiming for the truth.</p>"
