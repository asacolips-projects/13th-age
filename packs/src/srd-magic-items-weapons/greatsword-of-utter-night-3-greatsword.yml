    value: "<p>(Recharge 6+) When you hit with this weapon, you spirit away that enemy and yourself to an empty void beyond time where only the two of you face each other for a short time. Neither you nor your foe can move, but you can sure fight. Your enemy acts first, then you, and then you are both spirited back to the real world exactly where you were when the power triggered. Bystanders only see a flash of black.</p>\n<p>Quirk: Has disturbing dreams that can&rsquo;t be remembered, or at the very least must not be.</p>"
