    value: "<p>Fifty feet of fine, spidersilk rope, woven so closely that it seems like a solid, flexible cable. Once you attune the rope during a full heal-up, you can make it entangle things with standard action commands. In combat, it&rsquo;s not that useful, because it&rsquo;s slow compared to a living thing. If the target is stationary, however, the rope excels at reaching, climbing, snaking, coiling, and entangling. You might be able to get the rope to bind a ferocious monster, but the rope is likely to get destroyed in the process.</p>\n<p>Quirk: Speaks in sentences for which &ldquo;convoluted&rdquo; is the only proper term.</p>"
