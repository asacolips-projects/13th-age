# Description

Create characters in this FoundryVTT character sheet that is compatible with the _13th Age Roleplaying Game_. It has full support for players to easily create characters and GMs to easily create monsters, including both compendiums and easy to use rolls in power cards and monster actions. Compendium entries are based on the OGL content for the _13th Age Roleplaying Game_, and conversion of them to FoundryVTT compendiums is still in progress for some classes. Rules unrelated to classes or monsters are not provided in this system, which means that the _13th Age Roleplaying Game_ is required to play it.

# Install

1. Go to the setup page and choose Game Systems.
2. Click the Install System button, and either search for Toolkit13 or paste in this manifest link:
    * Foundry 0.6.x: [https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/archmage/raw/master/system.json](https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/archmage/raw/master/system.json)
3. Create a game world using the new sytem.

# Inline Rolls

All powers and monster actions require usage of inline dice rolls, such as `[[d20+@str+@lvl+@ed+2]]` to function with automation and dice rolls in chat messages. Many of the compendium entries for powers come preformatted using this syntax, but some are still in progress. For a full reference of how to use inline rolls, go to the settings tab of the right sidebar and click the "Archmage Inline Rolls" button.

# Contributing

Contributions are accepted and encouraged! To contribute to the project, fork this repository and then submit your changes as a pull request against the `master` branch.

## Building locally

This project uses **gulp** for the majority of its build tasks, but it also uses **vite** to compile its Vue components for usage in character sheets. Source files are located in the `src/` directory and are compiled to the `dist/` directory. To use the locally built system in Foundry, symlink your `dist/` directory to `systems/archmage` in your Foundry data directory.

To run a build, you'll need node 16 installed. Once you have node and npm, install the project
dependencies:

```
npm install
```
The following commands can be used for various versions of build tasks:

```bash
# One time build
npm run build
# Watch for changes and build automatically
npm run watch
# Compile CSS only
npm run css
# Compile manifests and language files only
npm run yaml
# Compile compendium databases only
npm run compilePacks
# Extract compendium databases to yaml files
npm run extractPacks
# Compile vue components only
npm run vite:build
# Watch for changes in vue only
npm run vite:watch
```

## Working with Vue

This system uses Vue for character sheets and will eventually use it for other sheet types as well. For more information on how to work with the Vue components, see the README.md in `src/vue/README.md`.
